<h1>This is what happens when you type www.google.com in your browser and click enter</h1>

<p>Have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter? Many complex processes occur to bring up the Google homepage almost instantaneously. Let’s explore these steps in detail.</p>

1. DNS Request<br>
<p>When you type https://www.google.com, the first thing your browser does is to resolve the domain name to an IP address. This process is called DNS (Domain Name System) resolution.</p>

<p>Local Cache: First, the browser checks its local cache to see if it has recently resolved this domain.</p>
<p>Operating System Cache: If the browser cache doesn’t have the IP address, it asks the OS cache.</p>
<p>Router: If it’s still unresolved, the query goes to your router, which also has a DNS cache.</p>
<p>ISP DNS Server: If all caches miss, the query is sent to your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP) DNS server.</p>
<p>Recursive Search: If the ISP DNS server doesn’t have the answer, it performs a recursive search, querying other DNS servers until it finds the authoritative DNS server for google.com.</p>
<p>The authoritative DNS server responds with the IP address of Google’s servers.</p>

2. TCP/IP <br>
<p>With the IP address obtained, your browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to the server.</p>

<p>Three-Way Handshake: The browser sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server, the server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet, and the browser replies with an ACK (acknowledge) packet. This establishes a reliable connection.</p>
<p>IP: The data is sent over the Internet using the IP (Internet Protocol), ensuring it reaches the correct destination.</p>
3. Firewall <br>
<p>Firewalls along the path check the packets to ensure they are safe and allowed through.</p>

<p>Local Firewall: Your computer’s firewall checks outgoing packets.
Network Firewall: Your router’s firewall also checks these packets.
Destination Firewall: Firewalls at Google’s end ensure the incoming traffic is legitimate.</p>
4. HTTPS/SSL
<p>Once the TCP connection is established, the browser initiates an SSL/TLS handshake to secure the connection.</p>

<p>Handshake: The browser and server exchange SSL/TLS certificates and establish a secure, encrypted connection.</p>
<p>Encryption: Data sent between the browser and the server is encrypted, ensuring privacy and data integrity.</p>
5. Load-Balancer <br>
<p>The request reaches Google’s servers, but to manage the massive traffic efficiently, Google uses load balancers.</p>

<p>Load Distribution: The load balancer distributes incoming requests across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
Health Checks: It also checks the health of servers to route traffic to the most capable and available ones.</p>
6. Web Server<br>
<p>The load balancer forwards the request to a web server.</p>

<p>Processing Request: The web server (like Apache or Nginx) handles the incoming request, determining what needs to be done.</p>
<p>Static Content: If the request is for static content (like images, CSS, or JavaScript files), the web server directly serves these files.</p>
7. Application Server<br>
<p>For dynamic content, the request is passed to an application server.</p>

<p>Logic Processing: The application server (like Node.js, Python, or Java-based servers) executes server-side logic, processes user input, interacts with databases, and generates the necessary content for the web page.</p>
<p>Session Management: It manages user sessions, ensuring personalized experiences for logged-in users.</p>
8. Database <br>
<p>If the application server needs data, it queries the database.</p>

<p>Query Execution: The application server sends a query to the database server (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Google’s internal database systems).
Data Retrieval: The database server processes the query, retrieves the necessary data, and sends it back to the application server.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>After all these steps, the application server generates the HTML for the Google homepage, which is sent back through the web server, load balancer, and over the encrypted connection to your browser. The browser then renders the HTML and any CSS and JavaScript displaying the Google homepage.</p>
